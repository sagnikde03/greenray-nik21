# Hola! <img src="https://github.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/blob/master/gifs/Hi.gif" width="35px">

### A little bit about Myself:- 
I’m a 3rd year undergraduate currently pursuing my Bachelors (B.Tech) in Electronics and Communication Engineering  from [Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics (IRPE), University of Calcutta, India](https://www.caluniv.ac.in/campuses/campus-8.html). Prior to that, I completed my schooling from [Don Bosco School, Liluah](https://donboscoliluah.org/).

I am currently tackling problems in 3D Vision, more specifically Human Activity Recognition(HAR). Therefore my work revolves around 3D ConvNets, various fusion techniques and GPUs. Besides that I have also built numerous projects hosted In my [repos](https://github.com/sarobml2000?tab=repositories) on a variety of topics encompassing Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and a little bit of NLP. I hope to work more with Computer Vision, Imaging and Backend Dev in the future.

### Some resources to look into if you are interested in 3D Vision and Videos:-

My work lead me to look up a lot of things on the web most of which was present in obscure blogposts and difficult to find out websites. Therefore the following list contains links to some of the websites which I found out to be tremendously helpful and instrumental to understanding 3D Vision better. Maybe some of these will smoothen your journey a bit :)

1. An excellent [blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/literature-survey-human-action-recognition-cc7c3818a99a) post with all the literature to help you get started. It's sequence brings out the motivation behind subsequent works.
2. Another [blog](https://blog.qure.ai/notes/deep-learning-for-videos-action-recognition-review) which speaks about the parallels between Video classification and Medical Imaging.
3. A [presentation](https://github.com/sarobml2000/sarobml2000/blob/main/A%20General%20Overview%20of%203D%20Convolution%20.pptx) I made where I explain 3D Convolution with example research literature in detail.
4. Real time deployment of 3D CNN models nicely explained [here](https://medium.com/@neurodatalab/real-time-action-recognition-using-a-3d-cnn-827686b25c08).
5. A [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65273118/why-is-tensorflow-not-recognizing-my-gpu-after-conda-install) I asked on StackOverflow because I wasn't aware that Tensorflow had faulty builds as well. Can save you a lot of headache if working with TF 2.3.0 .

### Opportunities:-
I am open to research projects and other kind of opportunities in Vision. Click [here](https://github.com/sarobml2000/sarob.github.io/blob/main/Sarosij_Bose_Univ_of_Calcutta.pdf) to view my Resume.

### Other Stuff:-
Our team [qualified](https://github.com/sarobml2000/sarobml2000/blob/main/University_of_Calcutta_Sarosij%20Bose_EcoGeeks_Mumbai.pdf) for the Hult prize 2021 Mumbai regionals where we spoke about our startup 'EcoGeeks'. Also have a look at our College's CodeChef Chapter's [Linkedln Page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cu-codeclub/) where I am a part of the Executive team to promote awareness about coding in our campus. 

### Reach me:-
Through my [Linkedln Profile](www.linkedin.com/in/sagnik-cu-a85127224) or mail me at [sagnikde2003[at]gmail[dot]com](mailto:sagnikde2003@gmail.com).
